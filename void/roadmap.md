# Important changes
-   Create functions (Almost).
    -   Think of a way to load function arguments (arity). Perhaps `CALL {FUNCTION} {ARITY}` to load `{ARITY}` arguments to the stack.
-   Have the Value types in rules rather than floats, ints, etc. (does not impact performanceÂ¿?)
-   Function arguments!!
-   Fix what happens if something is pushed into the stack in the function and not poped.
