# Important changes
-   Change instructions to enums for simplicity and speed.
-   Create functions.
    -   Think of a way to load function arguments (arity). Perhaps `CALL {FUNCTION} {ARITY}` to load `{ARITY}` arguments to the stack.
-   Have the Value types in rules rather than floats, ints, etc.
